            <p>Kanye West began his early production career in the mid-1990s, creating beats primarily for burgeoning local artists
            around his area, eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic soul records. His
            first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on Down to Earth, the 1996
            debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav.[41] For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for Deric "D-Dot" Angelettie.
            Because of his association with D-Dot, West was not able to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and
            producer of the Go-Getters, a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him, GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe, and
            Arrowstar.[42][43] His group was managed by John Monopoly, Don Crowley, and Happy Lewis under the management firm Hustle
            Period.</p>

            <p>On June 30, 2020, West released the single, titled "Wash Us in the Blood", featuring fellow American rapper and singer
            Travis Scott, along with the music video, which was set to serve as the lead single from his tenth studio album Donda,
            and draws similarities to the sound of his 2013 album Yeezus.[193] However, in September 2020, West stated that he would
            not be releasing any further music until he is "done with [his] contract with Sony and Universal"[194] in a Twitter rant
            about record company contracts, payments towards artists and musicians, and the topic of ownership of their masters. On
            October 16, he released the single "Nah Nah Nah". On October 29, a remix was previewed over Twitter, featuring American
            rappers DaBaby and 2 Chainz.[195] The remix was released November 13.[196] On December 25, 2020, exactly one year after
            the release of Jesus is Born, West's Sunday Service released a new EP entitled Emmanuel.</p>

            <p>At the July 22 listening party at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, West had taken up temporary residence in one of the stadium's
            locker rooms, converting it in to a recording studio to finish the recording and mixing with Mike Dean. Videos and
            photos posted to social media also showed featured artists Playboi Carti and 2 Chainz recording vocals in the locker
            room a day before the listening party.[199][200][201][202] A second listening party event at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium
            took place on August 5, 2021, with West stating that the album would be released on the same day.[203][204][205][206]
            However, this did not materialize.[207] On August 18, 2021, he announced a third listening party scheduled for August
            26, 2021 at the Soldier Field Stadium in Chicago.[208] After multiple delays, Donda was eventually released on August
            29, 2021.[209] West claimed the album was released early without his approval.</p>
